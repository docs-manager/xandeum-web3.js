/**
 * Constructs a Solana transaction to assign a co-owner to a file or directory
 * identified by a file system ID (`fsid`).
 * 
 * @param fsid - A stringified integer representing the file system ID where the co-owner is to be assigned.
 * @param path - The path within the file system.
 * @param coowner - The public key of the co-owner to be assigned.
 * @param wallet - The public key of the wallet that will sign and authorize the transaction.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to a Solana `Transaction` object containing the assignCoowner instruction.
